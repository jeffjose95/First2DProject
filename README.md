# First2DProject
My first 2D game made using the Unity game engine. You can start the game by clicking on game.html. 
Once inside the game, Start playing by clicking on the start key. 

Move around with either wasd or the movement keys. 
Hold on to the up and down keys to see what is right under you. 
Hold the q key to lose your ability to accelerate but see the area around you from a more zoomed out position.
